José Ariche spent his formative years under the careful tutelage of his grandfather, learning the ancient and sacred ways of the tribal shaman. Through years of dedicated practice and spiritual discipline, he mastered the ability to draw upon his tonal spirit, attune himself to the whispers of his innermost soul, and establish profound connections with the celestial bodies above. In his role as shaman, José inherited the weighty responsibility of serving as guardian and protector of his people, defending them against malevolent demons and destructive spirits that threatened their agricultural livelihood and seasonal harvests.

The peaceful existence of Duro Village was shattered when an unprecedented threat cast its dark shadow over the community. In this critical moment, José was forced to reach deeper into his spirit than he had ever dared before, channeling his tonal spirit to previously unexplored depths. This desperate act of spiritual communion resulted in an extraordinary and unexpected transformation within him.

Now, embracing his newfound powers and sacred purpose, José prowls through the darkness as Nagual, a mysterious shapeshifting hero who takes the form of a powerful jaguar. In this guise, he dedicates himself to confronting and defeating the malevolent forces that threaten the safety and well-being of his country's people.
