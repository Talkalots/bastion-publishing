Rico Homem was born into immense wealth and unquestioned power. As the only son of a prominent Central American cattle baron, there were no obstacles or limitations that stood between him and his every whim and desire. When his father passed away under mysterious circumstances, Rico inherited his family's vast agricultural empire—but his ambitious gaze was already fixed on greater horizons. More expansive lands, larger herds of cattle, greater stores of money, and increasingly absolute power became his obsession. A constant, insatiable hunger for dominance drove his every action and decision.

During a calculated raid to destroy a troublesome indigenous village that refused to yield their ancestral lands, Rico encountered a terrifying demon jaguar with eyes that blazed like golden fire. As he fled in panic through the dense jungle, he tumbled headlong into a deep earthen chasm where he discovered an ancient artifact—a golden armband, exquisitely crafted in the shape of a coiling serpent—resting undisturbed upon a weathered stone altar. The moment he slipped the mysterious relic onto his arm, Rico Homem's mortal existence came to an abrupt end. In his place arose Estrangular, the living incarnation of the Vision Serpent, the ever-thirsty god of blood whose appetite for sacrifice knew no bounds.
